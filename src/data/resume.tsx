  summary:
  "In 2024, I decided to commit full time to Recruitr AI, an AI-powered platform streamlining hiring for companies at scale. As a final-year computer science student at VIT Chennai with hands-on experience in diverse areas gained through internships at Ford, FLSmidth, and Bhai AR, I focus on building impactful solutions to real-world problems. Beyond my startup, I like actively sharing knowledge through workshops on AI and various other technologies. I have participated in hackathons (with multiple wins). I am driven by a belief that great engineering combines simplicity, impact, and a constant pursuit of learning, whether through startups, robotics, or education.",
